I am currently a graduate student and the University of Vermont here in beautiful Burlington Vermont.  My academic interests focus on phosphotyrosine signaling, an essential process in mammalian cells.  More specifically, my research involves interaction of these phosphorylated tyrosine residues with Src Homology 2 domains that bind to a \"YXXP\" motif.  \r\n\r\n###Links\r\n",
